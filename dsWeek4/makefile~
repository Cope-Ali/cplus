# Program:
#     Assignment 04, DEQUE
#     Brother Kirby, CS235
# Author:
#     Ali Cope & Ashleigh Walter
# Summary:
#     This program will use a custom deque to take input from the
#     user to get help from the tutoring center, keeping in mind, 
#     unless it's an emergency, they will be added to the end and 
#     the display will list the current standings minute by minute.
#     The custom deque will allow items to be added to either end 
#     as well as be removed from either end.
# Time:
#     Paired Programming: 3 hours
#     Ashleigh Walter: 16 hours
#     Ali Cope:12 hours
# The Hardest Part:
#     Ashleigh Walter: We have struggled immensly with this 
#         assignment, mainly with getting our custom deque to 
#         work properly.  We initially had an issue with the data
#         overiding everything previously added, then everything
#         would end up being displayed in the deque but randomly
#         and finally having issue with the word portion not being
#         displayed which ultimately seemed like it was because our
#         loops weren't set up properly, but anyway, that is what
#         was the hardest for me.
