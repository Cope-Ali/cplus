# Program:
#     Assignment 05, SET
#     Brother Kirby, CS235
## Author:
#     Ali Cope & Ashleigh Walter
# Summary:
#     In this program we've created and used a custom set class that
#     will store a sorted set, in this case a set of cards for the
#     game, go fish.  The set will incorporate the use of iterators 
#     to search through the set and find elements, insert them, erase 
#     them, and sort them.
# Time:
#     Paired Programming: 2.5 hours
#     Ashleigh Walter: 11.5 hours
#     Ali Cope: 10.5 hrs
# The Hardest Part:
#     Ashleigh Walter: I think we struggled with our constructors 
#           again, as well as a few ways we were doing loops in 
#           our set class.  Once we found out where our errors were 
#           i felt like we did pretty well after that.  We also 
#           had a little trouble with the implimentation of of our
#           goFish display but eventually got that working as well.
